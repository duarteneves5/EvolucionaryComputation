    "# ðŸ“˜ Assignment: Comparative Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms on the Lunar Lander\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Objective\n",
    "This assignment aims to give you practical experience in evaluating and comparing the performance of two evolutionary algorithms â€” **Random Search (RS)**, **Evolution Strategies (ES)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** â€” using **statistically sound methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "- Use the Lunar Lander environment as a benchmark problem.\n",
    "- Run controlled experiments using adapting existing RS, ES and PSO implementations from class.\n",
    "- Analyze the results using appropriate statistical tools.\n",
    "- Report findings with clarity and scientific rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Gain hands-on experience tuning and running evolutionary algorithms.\n",
    "2. Learn how to design fair experimental comparisons.\n",
    "3. Apply statistical analysis to compare stochastic optimizers.\n",
    "4. Interpret and communicate experimental findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Experimental Setup\n",
    "- Use the implementations of ES and PSO on the **LunarLander-v2** task.\n",
    "- Fix a common evaluation budget (e.g. function evaluations).\n",
    "- Choose meaningful performance metrics (e.g., average reward per episode, success rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Run the Experiments\n",
    "- Perform **at least 15 independent runs** for each algorithm to account for stochasticity.\n",
    "- Record key performance metrics (e.g., best fitness, average fitness).\n",
    "- (Optional but encouraged) Test different hyperparameter settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Statistical Analysis\n",
    "- Use appropriate statistical tests to compare the performance:\n",
    "  - **Normality tests** (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk)\n",
    "  - **Parametric** (e.g., paired/unpaired t-test) or **non-parametric** (e.g., Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U) tests as appropriate\n",
    "  - Consider plotting **confidence intervals**, **boxplots**, or **convergence curves**\n",
    "- Discuss **effect sizes** and the **practical significance** of the results, not just statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Report\n",
    "Build a small report (1â€“2 pages) detailing :\n",
    "- **Methods**: Description of algorithms, setup, metrics\n",
    "- **Results**: Statistical outcomes, graphs, tables\n",
    "- **Discussion**: What the data shows, why one method might outperform the other\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: Summary, future improvements"
